              Mineral water that rises from the earth in the depths of the
              Borjomi Gorge, surrounded by mountains, was first discovered by a
              wounded deer that entered the water and came out completely
              healed. The huntsman who witnessed the miracle also tasted the
              water and shared its rejuvenating powers with others.

            <p class="discovery-paragraph">
              The history of Borjomi begins with a legend, according to which
              the live water was first discovered by a wounded deer. The water
              healed the deer, and a hunter who witnessed the miracle tasted the
              water for himself, felt its rejuvenating power, and shared it with
              others. According to historical sources, the mineral waters of the
              Borjomi gorge date back to the first millennium AD, as revealed by
              the seven stone baths discovered at the beginning of the 20th
              century. Archeological findings show that in those times, Borjomi
              water was valued for drinking as well as bathing.However, this
              place was abandoned because of the 16th-17th century wars, and
              unfortunately, its valuable sources were forgotten.

            The legendary brand’s history has passed through many eras before
            ours; today, we can state that “Borjomi” is the face of Georgia.
            Along with changing historical periods, the visual side of the brand
            has also varied. However, what matters the most remains unchanged —
            the water’s distinct taste, unique mineral blend, and rejuvenating
            properties. Today, Borjomi is more than just ordinary mineral water
            to us all. It is also our national symbol representing the tradition
            of Georgian guest-loving nature and making us all proud.Let’s travel
            together in Borjomi’s world- look at its history of more than 130
            years, feel the spirit of each era, and be proud as we honor our
            legend!
